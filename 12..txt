12. Write a program, which will find all such numbers between 1000 and 3000 
(both included) such that each digit of the number is an even number.The 
numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a 
single line.

CODE:
numbers = []
for x in range (1001, 3001):
    num_Split = [int(d) for d in str(x)]
    odd = False
    for y in range (0, len(num_Split)):
        if num_Split[y] % 2 != 0:
            odd = True
    if (odd == False):
        numbers.append(x)
print (numbers)
