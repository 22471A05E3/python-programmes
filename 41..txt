41. Write a program to generate and print another tuple whose values are even 
numbers in the given tuple (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10).

CODE:
evenTuple = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
print("Tuple Items = ", evenTuple)
for i in range(len(evenTuple)):
    if(evenTuple[i] % 2 == 0):
        print(evenTuple[i], end = "  ")
