113. Given 2 sets of integers, M and N, print their symmetric difference in 
ascending order. The term symmetric difference indicates those values that 
exist in either M or N but do not exist in both.
Input
The first line of input contains an integer, M.The second line contains M 
space-separated integers.The third line contains an integer, N.The fourth 
line contains N space-separated integers.
