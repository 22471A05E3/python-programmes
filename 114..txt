114. You are given words. Some words may repeat. For each word, output its 
number of occurrences. The output order should correspond with the input 
order of appearance of the word. See the sample input/output for 
clarification.
If the following string is given as input to the program:
4
bcdef
abcdefg
bcde
bcdef
Then, the output of the program should be:
3
2 1 1

CODE:
n_ish = int(input())
counter_dict = {}
words_list = []

for i in range(n_ish):
  word = input()
  words_list.append(word)
  if word in counter_dict:
    counter_dict[word] += 1
  else:
    counter_dict[word] = 1
    
print(len(counter_dict))
print(' '.join([str(counter_dict[word]) for word in counter_dict]))
