7. Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-
dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the 
array should be i * j.
Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,Â¡Y-1. Suppose the following inputs are given to the 
program: 3,5
Then, the output of the program should be:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]

CODE:
userInput = input("Enter values for row and column number:\t").split(",")
rownumbers=dimensions[0]
colnumbers=dimensions[1]
list = [[0 for col in range(colnumbers)] for row in range(rownumbers)]

for row in range(rownumbers):
    for col in range(colnumbers):
        list[row][col]= row*col

print(list)
