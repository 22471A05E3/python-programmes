16. Write a program that computes the net amount of a bank account based a 
transaction log from console input. The transaction log format is shown as 
following:
D 100
W 200
D means deposit while W means withdrawal.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
D 300
D 300
W 200
D 100
Then, the output should be:
500

CODE:
netbal = 0
while True:
    en= input()
    if not en:
        break
    values = en.split(" ")
    operation = values[0]
    amount = int(values[1])
    if operation=="D":
        netbal+=amount
    elif operation=="W":
        netbal-=amount
    else:
        pass
print(netbal)
